   <!-- VOCABULARY -->
   <!-- - - - - - - -->


<!-- You can include vocabulary through another file (recursively checked) -->
<?akita-include vocab1.xml?>

<!-- Or you can declare vocabulary right within the document. Note that the first value 
   (after the PI name) functions as an id, and the subsequent values are space-delimited IRIs.
   In the following example, two URIs are said to be synonyms for the same concept, given the
   id "art-of-war". -->

   <!-- DEFINING WF-CONFORMANT TREES -->
   <!-- - - - - - - -->

<!-- And then you identify the trees in the TEI file by connecting components with vocabulary. There are 
   two ways to create such a structure. -->

<!-- Method 1, by existing tree. This points to one or more elements by @xml:id that form the topmost
   hierarchy of the given tree. If you're used to prefacing an idref with #, you may do so, but you don't 
   have to. The reference system that emerges is then based on @n values in descendants of the target 
   element(s). Each idref value is treated as specifying parts of a single tree, not separate ones.
-->
<!-- In this example, the <div> with @id="d1" is picked as the top of the citable tree. That tree is
   defined as corresponding to the work the Art of War, and based on a 2002 edition. The reference system
   is the same as the 2002 edition, and it follows a logical reference scheme. -->
<?akita-mark-tree-by-hierarchy
   idrefs="#d1" 
   work="art-of-war" 
   scriptum="suntzu-2002"
   reference-scriptum="suntzu-2002"
   reference-system-type="logical"
?>

<!-- Method 2, by anchor sets. This points to anchors, e.g., <pb>, <lb>, <milestone> by @type, with
   one type per @level-N-type, where N can be whatever positive integer one likes, but there must not be
   any gaps. The reference system that emerges is based purely on anchors and their @n values, with the 
   text beginning with the first level-1-type and going through the end. Text before the first anchor 
   is ignored. This approach is vulnerable to common mistakes, because the rules of well-formedness will
   not dictate whether the levels correctly relate to each other. Such issues may be addressed as the
   Akita validation process is developed further.
-->
<!-- In this example, the entire <text> is refactored. Anchors with @type="refschemeApages" form
   the top layer of the new tree, and those with @type="refschemeAlines" form the second layer. As in the
   previous example, this new tree is identified as belonging to the work the Art of War, and to the 2002
   scriptum. The key difference is that it declares the reference system to be material in nature. -->
<?akita-mark-tree-by-anchors 
   level-1-type="refschemeApages"
   level-2-type="refschemeAlines"
   work="art-of-war" 
   scriptum="suntzu-2002"
   reference-scriptum="suntzu-2002"
   reference-system-type="material"
?>

<!-- Thus, you have a single TEI file, but with two concomitant trees and reference systems. Editors can 
   work as they like in the TEI file without having to worry about overlapping structures. -->
