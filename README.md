# Writing Fragment Identifiers

Resources for Writing Fragment Identifiers ("Writing Fragids," WFs), a fragid scheme for URIs that designate text-bearing objects or written works, to narrow the scope of the URI to a specific region of text.

## Key components

* [Draft specifications](writing%20fragids.xml) - official specifications for WF URIs, with conformance requirements for WF-conformant media types and WF processors.
* [WF functions](wf-functions.xsl) - a non-normative function library in XSLT; includes a WF URI parser
* [WF examples](wf-examples.xsl) - examples of WF URIs in a variety of works and scripta
* [Oxygen project](wf.xpr), for handling common tasks via [Oxygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/).

The subdirectory [tests](tests) contains XSpec resources to test the conformance suite; [schemas](schemas) contains schemas for various resources.

Other subdirectories such as [TEI](TEI) and [TAN](TAN) are, or will be, populated with resources providing supplemental guidelines on WF conformance in other media formats.
